                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    Hi! I am Kishorereddy, a third-year undergraduate at IIT Bhubaneswar, pursuing Computer Science and
                    Engineering. My friends and family call me just Kishore. I am known for my use of the Internet as
                    the go-to place to learn anything. To me, the Internet is the history of all the knowledge humans
                    have ever had ( with some exceptions, of course ).
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    Apart from academia, I spend my time learning things from the Internet, try and building something
                    from what I learned. Or just browsing for the latest updates in technology, Space Exploration, Electric
                    Vehicles, and International Affairs. And watching a movie or TV Series sometimes.
                </p><br>

                <h2> Technical Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    I am a Backend-Developer versed in NodeJs + express and NestJs. However, I am also acquainted with
                    the basics of Front End Development with beginner level knowledge in React. I have also spent some 
                    time in my first year on Machine Learning in Python, thus gaining a good knowledge of the working 
                    and implementation of different ML techniques. I've even participated in a Data Science competition 
                    in 8th Inter IIT Techmeet held at IIT Roorkee in December 2019, reaching the final level!

                    If you'd like to know more about my current skill set, please contact me through email. I'll be more 
                    than happy to share my resume!

                    Every time I learn a new skill, I experiment with it and build something out of it. It helps me in
                    better grasping. Please head over to my <a href="timeline.html">Timeline</a> to know about my work.
