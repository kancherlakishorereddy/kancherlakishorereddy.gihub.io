                <h2> How to talk to your friends using whatsapp status</h2>
                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    First set your whats app status privacy to 'Only share with' and select the people you want to talk to.
                    Then stop replying to all their msgs in any grps or dms to get them give attention to your whats app more.
                    So that they will immediately check your statuses. Now start your messaging on statuses. Whatever you wanna 
                    tell them post a status of it. If they dm you don't reply to it and let them start using status to talk to you.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    You have to entirely stop using whatsapp for chats and only use status for this chatting using to happen.
                    If your friends are so dumb and dont get what you're doing, There is only way to make this happen just leave them.
                    Just kidding you can start by keeping sad emojis or gifs in status sometimes a full stop '.' can say the loneliness you feel,
                    because those dfs dont get you're point.

                <h2> The Last Resort</h2>
                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    You should only try this if your frnds are dumb af and zero in creativity and there is nothig more you think you can
                     do to get them talking on statuses. Write a fake blog post on internet and let those dfs know what you're trying to do.
                    Well, how do you tell them!!! No surprises here.. keep it in status.... You can thank me now not later.
                    Now your frnds will read this post and get what you're doing. And if they care any little you can expect a reply on to your status
                     with their status. Know that i am shedding a tiny little terlet for you using this last resort. Good luck you weirdo...

                <h2> To those who got this link in status of your friend</h2>
                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    Know that your friend who put this status is absolutely lying about the status chatting thing. He is just another df who is holding a grudge for 
                    some thing you did and stopped talking but desn't know how to start talking agaain cause again he has some issues and needs to go to therapy once he starts earning.
                    Anyways if you're reading upto this point could you are enough to call him and talk about random shot so that he can feel comfortable talking to you again.
                    I am tellig you he is not gonna respond to your msg unless you call, even if the world is coming to an end h would just kill himself woth little pain rather
                    than facing it with you cause HE DOESN'T KNOW WHY BUT HE IS SUPER HIGH ON ADRERNALINE WITH NEW CAPTAIN AMERICA COMMITTING MURDER IN BROAD DAY LIGHT CAUSE THE MURDERD ONE'S LEADER KILLED HIS FRIEND.

                    You know what just call him okay and talk some shit make him feel comfortable again with you. (That's why I saaid above he needs to go to therapy.)
